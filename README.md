<h1>Jorts</h1>
<h3>A different kind of pick up app.</h3>
<p>
The creators of JORTS, Dylan Weinberger & Emily McCracken, are residents of the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia. Surrounded by green space and a desire to get out of the house but with a schedule that didn't allow participating in regularly scheduled sporting events, Dylan decided this was a problem that needed to be solved. This is where Jorts was ultimately born. Dylan & Emily wanted to create an easy and fun app that would allow users to create activities in their area while other users searched for them and joined. Users choose the type of activity and the level of intensity when creating a new activity.

Activities on JORTS range from casual frisbee games to intense pick-up basketball and even some competitive quizzo at a local bar! At JORTS, we want to do everything we can to make it as easy as possible to get out of the house and enjoy your favorite activities with other people! If you make new friends-- great! If you find a new sport you love-- awesome! If you find yourself spending more time outdoors and/or while exercising your body or brain-- best case scenario!
